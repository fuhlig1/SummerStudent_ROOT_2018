# ROOT Tutorial

This tutorial is an introduction to the program package ROOT
(https://root.cern.ch). It covers the basic features of the program package
from starting up ROOT, doing some simple calculations up to complex examples
like writing data to file as a TTree.
This tutorial is used for the GSI Summer Student Program 2018.

If you don't have ROOT installed on your computer the easiest way to try
it yourself is to use a virtual machine with all necessary programs
installed.
